# Advent Of Code 2021

These are the Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Elixir.
In order to run the code, you need Elixir 1.12 or later installed, and at
least version 24 of the BEAM virtual machine.

All the solutions are placed in `lib/solutions`, all test cases are placed in
`test/solutions`, and all inputs are placed in `priv`.
The inputs are not included in this repository, as they differ on a per-person
basis.
Therefore, you can use the `init_day.exs` script to download the inputs and
place them in the correct place.
To do this, run `mix run init_day.exs --day <DAY> --only-input`.
